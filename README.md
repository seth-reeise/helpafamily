Impactful ways to help families in need through donated meals, hygiene kits, and more.

This repo contains the code behind [helpafamily.margaritahumanitarian.org](https://helpafamily.margaritahumanitarian.org/). While the short-term goal is to provide ways for donors to help families in the Antelope Valley, the long-term goal is to help families in need at a global scale through international volunteers and partnering humanitarian organizations around the world.
